Final Report

Objective
  Build a reproducible TMDB movie analytics pipeline to extract, clean, enrich, analyze, and visualize movie data, focusing on financial metrics and cast/crew insights.

Overview
  End-to-end workflow: extraction,
   cleaning, KPI enrichment, 
   analytics, and visualization. 
   Credits are parsed to expose cast, crew, directors, and their sizes. 
   KPIs add profit and ROI for financial views.
  Outputs are stored locally as CSVs for portability and downstream use.

Methodology
  Extraction fetches selected movie IDs and stores raw responses. 
  Cleaning parses JSON-like fields, normalizes data types, converts budget and revenue to millions, derives cast/crew/directors and size columns, drops noise, and reorders fields.
  KPI Calculation computes profit and ROI. Analytics compares franchise vs standalone and ranks directors. 
  Advance filtering 
  Visualization generates charts and plots from the enriched dataset.

  Avatar emerges as a revenue leader, generating the highest profit and ROI despite lower budget than Avengers Endgame.

  Franchise films dominate revenue rankings with The Avengers Collection leading at 7.7 billion in total revenue.

  Director collaborations such as Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, and Jennifer Lee with Chris Buck, deliver both high revenue and strong ratings.

  Limited sci-fi genre representation in the curated dataset, with only one title present.

Conclusions

  The pipeline reliably normalizes TMDB data, enriches it with cast and crew signals, and surfaces financial KPIs suitable for franchise and director analysis.

  Revenue concentration in major franchises validates the value of franchise IP in the film industry.

  Director reputation correlates with both revenue and audience ratings.

Next Steps

  Expand the movie ID list to strengthen statistical confidence and reduce potential skew from a small sample.

  Develop interactive dashboards for franchise and director performance visualization.

  Implement automated regression testing for data parsing and KPI calculations.

  Maintain vault-based secret management to ensure no API credentials leak into version control.
